<h2>Chess software as source RPMs</h2>
<ul>

<p>Crafty is an xboard chess engine by Bob Hyatt -- featureful, strong-ish, based on a lot of theory and experience.
<p>TogaII is a UCI chess engine by Fabien Letouzey, strong, but not tops.
<p>Polyglot simulates an xboard chess engine by driving a UCI engine underneath;
this makes shredder, stockfish, TogaII, Beowulf, etc, accessible in chessdb and xboard.
This build of polyglot features additional functions useful for analysis.
<p>ChessDB, derived from Scid, is a fine database program for analyzing existing chess games, or running an engine, but
not for playing games.
<p>I do not supply binaries, because you should not run binaries you find in random places around the internet. Compile them yourself.
