<h2>Vincent Broman family interests</h2>
<p>VB's professional stuff used to be found at his work place,
but policies changed, and some of it will appear here.
This site has his spare-time and hobbyist materials.

and if you are in his address book, the email won't be discarded as spam.
<ul>
<li> <a href="chess.html">Chess</a> software and games
<li> The <a href="gnt.html">Greek New Testament</a> and textual criticism
<li> LifeLines <a href="reports.tgz">report programs</a>,
from mailing list postings,
intended for Tom Wetmore's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=852">LifeLines genealogy software</a> on SourceForge.
These are already in the distribution by now.
<li>Fireside Chat <a href="firesides.html">slides and handouts</a>.
<li> V Broman <a href="BromanPGPKey">GnuPG or PGP Keys</a>
</ul>
<p>Most of the files on this site which are not HTML or RPM are stored in
ZIPped form, with CRLFs, usually with one file per archive so that gzip can
also handle it.  If your mailcap maps .zip to something like zless or  unzip -p,
you should be able to see the files, not just download them.
Reformatting the Greek material into Unicode is a backburner project.
