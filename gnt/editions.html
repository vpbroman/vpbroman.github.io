<h2>Greek New Testament Editions</h2>
<p>
These machine-readable GNT copies are generally in two formats,
those from the Online Bible looking like a printout with line-wrapping
and separate book and chapter header lines,
others were filtered so as to have TLG (Beta) transliteration,
one line per verse or per parsed word,
and complete references on each line.
<p>
Bracketed words or parts of words indicate material which is of
dubitable authenticity as part of the original text.
Most of these texts contain no accents, breathings, nor diacritics, not
even punctuation.
In the Byzantine texts (other than IGNTP John),
wherever a moveable nu or sigma is permitted, it is included.
<ul>
<li> Stephanus (Robert Etienne's) 1550 edition,
<a href="steph.zip">printout from OLB</a> or
<a href="steph-l.zip">Unix line-per-verse format</a> or the
<a href="steph-lw.zip">same with numbered words</a> for collation,
being an early and well-known Textus Receptus.
The bracketed phrases therein are traditional subscriptions to some of the books.
<li> The <a href="elzevir.zip">Elzevir 1624 Edition</a> of the TR, transcription by Maurice Robinson.
<li> Scrivener's 1894 edition,
<a href="scriv.zip">printout from OLB</a> or
<a href="scriv-l.zip">Unix line-per-verse format</a>,
an attempt to reconstruct the Greek Vorlage for the KJV NT,
insofar as this can be found in Greek MSS,
without retranslating Vulgate readings back into unattested Greek.
<li> <a href="tr-parsd.zip">Parsed and lemmatized Stephanus with Scrivener variants</a> from the OLB.
<li> Oxford 1873 Textus Receptus of John, the official IGNTP form for its collating base,
<a href="john-tr.zip">original printout-like file</a>,
<a href="johnnums-tr.zip">the same with repeated words numbered</a>
for collation,
<a href="igntpj-l.zip">Unix line-per-verse format</a>, and
<a href="igntpjlw.zip">Unix format with repeated words numbered</a>.
<li> The Robinson-Pierpont Majority Text:
<a href="byz.zip">printout from OLB</a>,
<a href="byz-l.zip">Unix format</a>, or
<a href="byz-prsd-nc.zip">parsed and lemmatized form</a>.
The current, 2000 version is in <a href="byz2000.line.gnt.gz">gzipped plain text</a>
and <a href="byz2000-prsd.line.gz">gzipped parsed form</a>.
This is the edition by Robinson and Pierpont of a Majority, or Byzantine,
text of the NT.
It is similar to an earlier production of Hodges and Farstad
in being based on von Soden's apparatus,
but without a stemmatic reconstruction
of the Apocalypse and the Pericope Adulterae.
<li> <a href="tisch8.zip">Tischendorf's 8th major edition</a>, newly proofed,
without apparatus, of course.
<li> Plain <a href="w-h-l.zip">Westcott-Hort edition</a> Unix format.
<li> Nestle-Aland 26th/27th edition,
<a href="na26-l.zip">plain Unix format</a> or
<a href="na26.zip">Unix format with diacritics and punctuation</a>.
<li> Westcott-Hort edition combined with NA26 variants,
<a href="wh-n26.zip">OLB ZIPped format</a> or
<a href="wh-or-na-l.zip">Unix line-per-verse format</a>.
<li> <a href="parscode.zip">Docs for codes in parsed texts</a>.
<li> <a href="na26ordr.zip">CCAT user agreement and order form</a> for obtaining various machine-readable texts,
including an NA26 with capitalization, font changes, indentation, etc.
<li> The CCAT at UPenn has also put out a parsed and lemmatized copy of
the NA26 text, with a different format than that of the OLB files above.
The <a href="ccat-mrp.zip">line-per-word database</a> is described by
some accompanying <a href="ccatcode.zip">documentatation</a>.
James Tauber has corrected errors and amplified the parsing in the CCAT
data in this bigger <a href="tauber-morph.zip">database</a>, with some
sketchy <a href="tauber-vss.zip">explanation of updates</a>,
partly due to myself.
</ul>
<p>The NA26/27 text is collated against the 2000 Robinson-Pierpont text
in this <a href="nabydiff.zip">collation package</a>, which includes
classified verbal differences, verse division differences, and which
is organized into 6893 units of variation.  Python scripts used in
producing and testing the info are included.
<p>The OLB parsed texts were updated in 2001-07 by Robinson and are now
accessible here:
<a href="trparsed.zip">Stephanus</a>,
<a href="byzparsed.zip">Byzantine</a>,
and <a href="whparsed.zip">Westcott-Hort</a> texts.
<p>
Some of these files were obtained from the staff or the distributions
of the Online Bible, after some filtering, massaging, and reformatting.
Particular thanks go to Dr. Maurice Robinson for lots of contributions here.
Other files originate from the CCAT gopher.  Clint Yale provided
the Tischendorf edition and was working on scanning the apparatus;
this is being sold somewhere.
<p>
Eighteen corrections to the CCAT NA26 text were made on 6 feb 1999.
These corrections updated both the NA26 texts and the NA-BY collation.
