                      EDWARD C. HOBBS on GREEK LEXICA

     ( I'm a long-time lexicon addict, owning every kind and type and
example, studying them assiduously, and criticizing them constantly.  I own
two, or even three, of almost all of these, so I'll be sure to have one
whether I'm in either of my offices or in my study.)

                           ---Classical Greek---

     The (financially) bad news is that really there is no choice for 
Classical Greek except the *only* current one: "New (9th) Edition" of
Liddell-Scott-Jones-McKenzie.

          _A Greek-English Lexicon_ compiled by Henry George Liddell
     and Robert Scott.  Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry
     Stuart Jones, with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie and with
     the co-operation of many scholars.  With a supplement, 1968,
     edited by E. A. Barber.  Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, 1968.
          [List price, $135]

     Oxford has announced a partially-new version of the 9th Edition with a
completely revised supplement (2378 total pp.)  The revised supplement by
Glare will also be available separately (288 pp.)  The new printing was
promised for June 1995; as of October 1995, it has been re-scheduled for
publication in March 1996.  The good news is that the price has been
dropped $10, to $125; even better news is that they have reinstated the
pre-publication offer-- order before January 31, 1996, and it will cost
only $100!  (All prices plus $3.50 shipping.)  The new version:

          _A Greek-English Lexicon: Ninth Edition with Revised
     Supplement_ compiled by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott. 
     Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones, with
     the assistance of Roderick McKenzie and with the co-operation of
     many scholars.  Supplement edited by P. G. W. Glare.  Oxford, at
     the Clarendon Press, 1996.
          [List price, $125]       [Supplement separately, $65]

     WARNING:  Since both Liddell and Scott died over a century ago, the
"Intermediate" [$35] and the "Abridged" [$30] Liddell-Scott, which fit in a
book-bag, are in fact not based on the L-S-J-M, but are over a century old
(1888 or 1889), based on the 7th ed. published in 1883 (usually and
incorrectly cited as 1882, based on the Preface date).  Since there is no
choice, one takes what one can get.  So either you shell out $135/$125 and
be happy, or you pay $35 (Intermediate, 914 pp.) or $30 (Abridged, 808 pp.)
and curse yourself every time you encounter the inadequacies AND the
antiquities of the latter.  (Incidentally, "Liddell" is pronounced
"LID-'l", as though spelled "Liddle", never Lid-DELL.  He was quite
insistent on it!  His daughter Alice was the Alice of "Alice in
Wonderland.")

     There is a Langenscheidt "pocket" edition, commended by Carl Conrad. 
I do not possess it myself, but I trust Carl's judgment.


                         ---New Testament Greek---

     There is still only one adequate choice:

     Walter Bauer, _A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other
Early Christian Literature_; translated into English by William F. Arndt
and F. Wilbur Gingrich from 4th edition; "Second Edition [1979], revised
and augmented by F. Wilbur Gingrich and Frederick W. Danker from Walter
Bauer's 5th edition, 1958."  University of Chicago Press; also available
from Zondervan.     [About $55]

     Unhappily, all three translators (Arndt, Gingrich, and Danker, the
latter two being friends of mine) chose to "revise" and to "augment" in
addition to translating; they are none of them any match for Bauer in
lexicography, with the consequences quite evident.  Often they simply
attack Bauer's entries, instead of translating them!  (See, as a really
hilarious example, "skenepoios".)  The absurd "causal eis," invented by J.
R. Mantey to support his fundamentalist-Baptist doctrine of John's baptism
(a matter of "translation driven by theology", as Gary Brower called it in
one of his postings!), was given a full five-line special entry in the 1st
ed. by Arndt & Gingrich; at least it was reduced in the 2nd ed. to three
lines, and credited solely to Julius Mantey (who obviously couldn't read
non-biblical Greek very well, as the great Greek scholar Ralph Marcus
carefully pointed out in two separate articles, despite Mantey's co-writing
a "grammar").  The result is that, although it is the best lexicon of the
Greek New Testament available in English, it still suffers from the
additions of its three translators.

     The more recent (6th) edition of Bauer (edited by Kurt and Barbara
Aland, 1988) is better; but it is in German, with no English translation
available for non-readers of German.

     [Footnote on Bauer-in-German:]  Even Bauer was guilty of "translation
driven by male-chauvinism" at times, the most incredible example being the
entry for "Junias".  This completely non-existent name is listed by Bauer
with the fanciful guess that it must have been a nickname for `Junianus',
and a statement that the purely theoretical possibility that the name is
`Junia' (a very common woman's name) is rendered impossible by the context! 
The "impossible" is that Paul's remarkable lady-relative Junia was an
apostle!  Horrors!  SURELY Phoebe was no deacon (a term Paul applies to
himself), and Junia was no apostle (a term Paul applies to himself)!  How
can a WOMAN have been chosen by God for REAL ministry?  Thank God, the NRSV
and a few other recent translations have now restored Junia to her place in
the apostolate, where even the King James Version had her.
     Even the great Bauer had his blindnesses!

-------
     	[Additional comments by Edgar Krentz concerning forthcoming revision
                    by Danker of the A-G-D translation of Bauer:]

     Fred Danker delivered the completed manuscript of the third edition to
     the University of Chicago Press in early April. (Can one call
     something on a hard disk a manuscript?)  I called Fred Danker about
     it; he tells me the target date for its appearance in print is the
     Society of Biblical Literature meeting in 1996, i.e. approximately
     Thanksgiving of that year.  I no longer have students purchase the 2nd
     edition because that date is close.  If you want more accurate
     information, you might drop a note to Prof. Frederick W. Danker, 3438
     Russell Ave., St. Louis, MO 63104. Tel.: 314-772-5757.
-------

     Wilbur Gingrich once prepared a small edition (_Shorter Lexicon of the
Greek New Testament_); a 2nd edition, with Fred Danker, came out in 1983,
and costs $30 for 221 pp.  It is SO small and costs so much that I consider
it not worth the bother.   Some like it for portability.  I tried using it
with students for a few years after it came out, but it was SO brief, had
so few "helps", and cost such a high proportion of the complete B-AG, that
I switched to requiring B-AG (later B-AGD).

     If I were to recommend a "portable" lexicon for New Testament Greek,
I'd try for Abbott-Smith, should it be still available and at a reasonable
price.  _A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament_ by G. Abbott-Smith (a
Canadian!).  This came out in 1921, 1923, and 1937 (editions 1 through 3),
and has been reprinted frequently since then, by T. & T. Clark (Edinburgh). 
I'm not sure if it is still in print, nor at what price.  But it was beyond
question the lexicon of choice prior to the appearance of Bauer in English;
I used it with my classes in those pre-1957 years.  It includes quite a bit
of information from the papyri, it gives many references to use of words in
LXX with the original Hebrew word (even pointed!) behind the Greek term or
word or usage, and includes a plethora of passages cited.  It also gives
etymologies (dangerous though that is?).

     To supplement Carl Conrad's brief warning on the Newman lexicon
published by the United Bible Societies:  The English-speaking Bible
Societies decided to have a small English lexicon bound with some printings
of UBS's _The Greek New Testament_, and Barclay M. Newman, Jr., got the job
(with the advice of, among others, my old roommate Erroll Rhodes).  This
lexicon is deceptive, misleading the very persons who use it -- beginners. 
It gives, in the main, the RSV translations of each Greek word.  If one
wants that, one can read an English New Testament, to wit, the RSV!.  It
isn't frightful, but since it is a poor lexicon on the whole, it is largely
useless.  Too bad that it's the only one bound with the UBS _Greek New
Testament_.

     The Louw & Nida lexicon is often mentioned.
          _Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament based on
     Semantic Domains_ edited by Johannes P. Louw and Eugene A. Nida,
     2 volumes; United Bible Societies [available through American
     Bible Society].  First Edition 1988; Second Edition, 1989.  Price
     is $35 for two-volume set-- would probably be $80-100 from any
     other publisher.
          While it does not replace the need for Liddell-Scott-Jones nor
for Bauer, it fills a real gap among lexica.  It has a rather specialized
use.  Not only is it organized "semantically," which requires using the
index volume constantly to discover where the desired word is to be found,
but it is primarily written for the use of translators of the New Testament
into languages not yet having Bibles in the vernacular.  It is very
"translation-oriented," which isn't usually what a researcher wants or
needs (unless one is a translator).
     (Incidentally, and happily, they ALWAYS refer to Bauer's lexicon
     as "Bauer's lexicon" or "Bauer's dictionary"; they initially
     mention it "as translated and revised by Gingrich and Danker". 
     Since no one refers to _Crime and Punishment_ as written by
     Constance Garnett, I don't understand why Americans like to refer
     to Bauer's lexicon as though it were written by its translators.)
The quickest way to see its virtues is to read their "Introduction" (pp.
vi-xx, same in both 1st and 2nd editions), and then to sample one article
in Vol. 1 and one in Vol. 2.

-------
     [Additional comments by Edgar Krentz concerning Louw & Nida:]

     Louw & Nida is difficult for a beginning student to use. The more
     acquaintance one has with ancient Greek literature beyond the Greek
     Bible, the more intelligently one can use it. It is *no substitute*
     for a traditional, alphabetically arranged lexicon. I would probably
     elect to have students use the old Abbott-Smith lexicon (T & T Clark)
     as a first lexicon, and send them to the library to use B-AGD, 2nd ed.
-------


                           ---Patristic Greek---

     Even when you have paid a small fortune for the LSJM, you will not
have a lexicon for the Church Fathers (Patristics), since that body of
literature was deliberately excluded from it.  

     The only serious option is: G. W. H. Lampe, _A Patristic Greek
Lexicon_, Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, 1961-1968.  No longer listed in
Oxford's catalogs, but still in print.  It is hideously expensive at $285,
hence is the only important lexicon of ancient Greek which I do not own;
I jog to the library when I need it.


                         ---"Septuagint" Greek---

     In LSJM, the LXX is given fairly short shrift, with the result that
many students find the older 8th edition (1897) better for LXX.  But, in
fact, there is NO really good lexicon yet for the LXX.  The reason is
pretty obvious: It is a translated collection, and one is often left
wondering whether to give the meaning of the Hebrew (or Aramaic) original
behind a word, or to give the (supposed) meaning in the head(s) of the
translator(s) based on other Hellenistic usage.  The Deutsche
Bibelgesellschaft has such a lexicon under way, though it is somewhat
sketchy, doing little of what such a lexicon should do (perhaps for the
reasons I outlined above).  The A-I volume (paperback), which came out in
1992, is $24 plus handling charge and tax.  It has 217 pages, plus
introduction.  The rest is planned for release by Christmas of 1995.
          _A Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint_,
     compiled by J. Lust, E. Eynikel, and K. Hauspie, with the
     collaboration of G. Chamberlain.

                         ---"Parsing Lexicons"---

     Concerning inflected-forms dictionaries:  The antique Liddell-Scott
Abridged  (over a century old, which should have been replaced decades ago
but hasn't been) parses forms which an English schoolboy reading Xenophon
et alia in "Public" School might have trouble with.  It covers few of the
forms New Testament readers are likely to find daunting.
     The old "Analytical Greek Lexicon" covered almost all forms in the New
Testament, but was filled with so many hundreds of errors that it was worse
than nothing, since the novice cannot spot these errors.  However, FEAR
NOT!  The dreadful 1852 Analytical Lexicon (1852, despite "1970" in
reprint!) was "corrected and revised" by Harold K. Moulton, published by
Bagster [original publisher of 1852 edition!] in 1977, in London, and in
1978 in the USA by Zondervan. Title: _The Analytical Greek Lexicon
Revised_: 1978 Edition.  Harold is the son of James Hope Moulton, and
grandson of W. F. Moulton, two great Greek grammarians.  This edition works
from photos of the early printing, with errors and misprints corrected, and
then has an addendum giving the forms which were omitted from the original
Bagster's Lexicon.  Wesley J. Perschbacher has also edited a corrected and
revised version of the 1852 edition: _The New Analytical Greek Lexicon_,
published by Hendrickson in 1990.  This version is newly type-set, with a
slightly better appearance on the page.
     Max Zerwick, S.J., of the Biblicum in Rome published his _Analysis
Philologica Novi Testamenti Graeci_ at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in
1953; I have the 3rd ed., 1966.  It goes through the New Testament verse by
verse, parsing odd forms, explaining the grammatical structures, solving
puzzles (Zerwick's solutions, of course), with references to his useful but
brief grammar.  It's in Latin, but for those who read only English and want
to learn Greek, Mary Grosvenor made a translation (also "revised and
adapted") in two volumes, 1974 (through Acts) and 1979 (Romans through
Apocalypse), titled _An Analysis of the Greek New Testament_.  Later came
out in a single volume; very handy, small format.
     A similar help, though much more "written down" to the beginner, a bit
patronizing, and uncomfortably protestant-conservative, is the Cleon Rogers
translation of Fritz Rienecker's _Sprachlicher Schluessel zum Greek New
Testament_: _Linguistic Key to the Greek New Testament_ (1976, 1980;
perhaps later editions), issued by Zondervan.  Also small, handy format.
     Sakae Kubo produced a nifty vocabulary guide for rapid reading of the
Greek New Testament: _A Reader's Greek-English Lexicon of the New
Testament_ (1967 through 1975, when a "beginner's guide" was added). 
Zondervan. It gives many helpful frequency tables, verb charts, inflection
charts, in addition to its main job: Going through the Greek New Testament
chapter by chapter, listing every word which occurs fewer than 5 times in
that book.  He assumes you know the 301 words occurring more than 50 times
in the Greek New Testament (he gives a list), then lists all words in the
book-in-hand (e.g., Romans) occurring more than 5 times in that book but
less than 50 in the whole New Testament.  One needs to know these to use
the volume for rapid-reading.  Then the infrequent words are given, with
quickie translations, verse by verse.  A VERY helpful tool for novices.  He
also gives a list of unusual or hard-to-spot forms, actually an abridgement
of the long list in Abbott-Smith's Manual Greek Lexicon.
     Finally, a book doing the same thing as the Analytical Lexicon, except
that it is arranged in the order the words occur in the New Testament
(i.e., one starts reading Matthew, and it parses every word in order (with
some high-frequency exceptions):  Nathan E. Han, _A Parsing Guide to the
Greek New Testament_, Herald Press, 1971.  It was printed from typed copy,
tolerably readable (but could be better).

Subject: CBD catalog, & lexica
To: NT-GREEK@Virginia.EDU

Responding to Jeffery Condit's citation of the CBD catalog:
	I deal with CBD often; I spend two hours driving to attend their
quarterly Saturday-super-sales.  But be wary of their PRICE CLAIMS, and
their descriptions.  A nice fellow writes the catalog descriptions, but
he knows little about real scholarship.  So he writes the kind of
nonsense quoted about BAGD (i.e., B, by AG/GD); Oliver Phillips is of
course correct, that Liddell-Scott-Jones is the ONLY comprehensive
lexicon of ancient Greek, to be supplemented by Bauer (preferably the
latest [I think 6th--my copy isn't in this room], but the AG, rev. GD,
translation of the 5th if necessary) for N.T. + other early Xn lit,
and by Lampe for patristic Greek.  PRICE CLAIMS: I haven't the latest
Chicago catalog handy, but CBD has always said the list is about $5 to $10 
more than it is.  Chicago and Zondervan both sell the AG/GD translation
of Bauer, at short discount.  I've always found that this lexicon is
cheaper at Harvard Divinity School Bookstore than at CBD, and often
also at Divinitas.   CBD software prices are HIGH; lower prices by mail
are easy to find, for what they carry.  But better stuff is usually
available elsewhere for MUCH less.  See Bob Kraft's early lists on this
LIST, available from U Penn; for Greek & Hebrew & Arabic, ChiWriter is
cheaper than anything else, from Horstmann (even better buy through
Paul Miller at Gramcord (see new address on early posting on this LIST).
Parsons Technology in Cedar Rapids, IA, has incredibly cheap English
translations with a fast-access program (many translations, including
NRSV [CORRECTED! -- it has the missing clause in Revelation!], in
the $50 range -- far lower than any CBD carries (CBD told me they
can't get Parsons programs [called QUICKVERSE -- be sure to get
version 2.0], probably because they are so low priced to begin with).
	LEXICON:  The Louw & Nida lexicon has been mentioned a couple of
times, and recently quoted on this LIST.  I would like to give it a
strong plug. (My qualifications for plugging it:  I'm a long-time
lexicon addict, owning every kind and type and example, studying them
assiduously, and criticizing them constantly.)  While the Louw & Nida
does not replace the need for Liddell-Scott-Jones nor for Bauer, it
fills a real gap among lexica.  (Incidentally, they ALWAYS refer to
Bauer's lexicon as "Bauer's lexicon" or "Bauer's dictionary"; they
initially mention "as translated and revised by Gingrich and Danker".)
The quickest way to see its virtues is to read their "Introduction"
(pp. vi-xx, same in both 1st and 2nd editions), and then to sample
one article in Vol. 1 and one in Vol. 2.  United Bible Societies,
available through American Bible Society.  Price is $20 for both
volumes in my last-spring catalog!  Would be $80-100 from anywhere
else.  Have your library get it if you can't afford $20.

Cindy Smith asks for recommendations on Classical Greek Lexica, and I send
her the following two references downloaded from our on-line library
catalogue, and I follow this by some comments on the "philosophy"
question also raised by someone else recently.

There are effectively only two choices for Classical Greek lexica in
print and of any real use.  The first is preferable but big and ex-
pensive--though perhaps not outrageously so as the world goes now.  It's
not what you'd lug off to class in the morning.  The second is an abridge-
ment of the first.  One abridges a book by leaving out things you really
need to know, but for basic reading purposes, it's the one.  Anything
smaller would be useless, even misleading.

Subject: Classical Greek textbooks
To: NT-GREEK@Virginia.EDU

In response to Gary Collier's inquiry about introductory textbooks for
Classical Greek:
	The nearest thing to a "standard" these days (and the best one
to my personal knowledge) is GREEK: AN INTENSIVE COURSE, by Hardy Hansen and
Gerald M. Quinn (New York: Fordham Univ. Press).  Be sure to look at the 
Second Revised Edition (1992) rather than the Revised Edition (1987).
Quinn was killed in an auto accident last year, but this edition was
already at the Press when he died.  The text was modeled (more or less)
on the wonderful LATIN: AN INTENSIVE COURSE, which I'm sure all of
you know.

Hello,  Friends,

Intermediate-level grammars of the Greek NT are few and far between.  
Subscribers to B-Greek may be interested in the forthcoming release from
Broadman & Holman called _Intermediate New Testament Greek: A Linguistic
and Exegetical Approach_ by Richard A. Young.  The release date is
August 12, 1994 in time for the Fall semester.

The book is designed to help students in NT Greek classes better use their
knowledge of Greek in the exegesis of the NT.  It accomplishes this goal
by augmenting traditional grammar with insights from modern linguistics.
The author takes students beyond the surface structure of the language by
introducing them to a number of modern linguistic models, including a
modified transformational grammar, propositional analysis, genre criticism,
semantic structural analysis, pragmatics, speech act theory, and
discourse analysis.

The book is written with clarity and precision, being neither too simple
nor overly cumbersome and pedantic.  Each chapter ends with exercises.
An Answer Key will be provided *free* to instructors who adopt the text.

Contents:  Introduction: Language Study and the Exegetical Task,
(1) Nominative, Vocative, and Accusative, (2) The Genitive, (3) The
Dative, (4) The Article, (5) Pronouns and Adjectives, (6) Prepositional
Phrases, (7) Present, Imperfect, and Future, (8) Aorist, Perfect, and
Pluperfect, (9) Voice and Mood, (10) Participles, (11) Infinitives,
(12) Conjunctions, (13) Adverbs and Particles, (14) Sentence Structure,
(15) Special Sentences and Clauses, (16) Figurative Language, (17)
Discourse Analysis, (18) Diagraming.

The book has a bibliography, subject and Scripture indices.  The 
ISBN is 0-8054-1059-7, and it will sell for $21.99.

> What about grammars?

The standard reference grammars are Blass, DeBrunner, Funk, "A Greek Grammar
of the NT and Other Early Christian Literature" and Moulton, Howard, Turner,
"Grammar of NT Greek" (4 vols.). Both are pretty "heavy" for even intermediate
students.

Much more accessible to many is Stan Porter's recent "Idioms of the Greek NT"
(Sheffield, 1992)--which is a full-fledged grammar, not just a treatment of
idioms. For a bit over 300 pgs. this one is very well done.

Coming next fall (95) from Dan Wallace is "Exegetical Syntax" (Zondervan) that
will be somewhere between an intermediate grammar and the big reference tools
(though it will be advertised as an intermediate). I'm working with 400+ pgs.
in draft form as a pilot run this fall in 2d year Greek and though I've just
received it this past week, my initial impressions are favorable..

There are some others, but these are the bet in my judgment. Dana and Mantey
was a standard in many circles for a long time, but is long outdated and I
wouldn't regard it as the most reliable at present.

Additions to the many lexicon comments:
 
ABS has a new LXX lexicon.  The first vol (A-I) is available now and they
say the second will be available later this year.  I think the price of the
first vol is about $20.  # 800-322-4253.
 
Oxford lists a forthcoming printing of the 9th edition of L&S with a revised
supplement (2378 total p.)  The supplement is supposed to be a complete
replacement of the 1968 supplement.  Price is $100 until May 15.  The new
supplement is available separately at $52 (288 p.)  # 800-451-7556.
 
The Oxford sale also covers the 3 basic editions of L&S @ $108 for the big
one, $28 for the Intermediate and $24 for the Abridged.

Several more comments and inquiries re: lexicons have come in, to which
I think I should respond.

(1) Ken Share has shared (!) his knowledge of a new Supplement to LSJ,
replacing Barber's (1968).  (I missed this catalog, apparently; mine
was Winter, and doesn't mention it.)  $100 for the whole LSJM, plus the
new Supplement, sounds like a great deal.  (I don't really need a
fourth copy of LSJM, do I?  But $52 for the 288 page Supplement alone
seems steep, when all the rest [2,111 pages] costs only another $48.)
     He also mentions the ABS publication of a Lexicon to the LXX.  I
didn't mention this for two reasons.  It is only half finished, though
the rest is due out before Christmas.  And it is a somewhat sketchy
job, doing little of what such a lexicon should do (perhaps for the
reasons I outlined in my previous post).  The A-I volume (paperback),
which came out three years ago, is $24 plus handling charge and tax. 
It has 217 pages, plus introduction.  Share is right -- I should have
mentioned it, and didn't.

(2) Perry Stepp touches on three matters:
     He heard that a new edition of BAGD "is due out soon."  Two years
ago, Fred Danker wrote that a revision is "due out before the year
2000."  But when I talked with him at length eight or nine months later
(Nov. 1993), he was really vague about it; he more or less blamed U. of
Chicago Press for stalling, and when I pressed him on a number of
aspects of the lexicon which desperately need correction, he again was
a bit vague about when (even if) anything could be done about them,
within any easily foreseeable time.  Thus, while I hope that Stepp's
informant was right (if so, to whom do we send criticisms and
revisions?), I do not think one should hold off on a purchase now in
hopes of getting something better soon.
     He likes the "Little BAG" for portability.  I tried using it with
students for a few years after it came out, but it was SO brief, had so
few "helps", and cost such a high proportion of the complete BAG, that
I switched to requiring BAG (later BAGD).  To tell the truth, if I were
pushed into a corner on recommending a "portable" lexicon for NT Greek,
I think I'd try for Abbott-Smith, should it be still available and at a
reasonable price.  (See below for more on Abbott-Smith.)
     Finally, Stepp asks about the Schmoller Handkonkordanz.  We had
quite a discussion of it a few years ago, when I spoke very negatively
about the Schmoller--as too bulky, and too unhelpful in many ways.  But
that is not the case with the Beate Koester revision of Schmoller,
which is a lovely little volume ($24.50 + handling) with quite a few
nice features.  I don't use it much at all, since I seem to know where
most of the passages are which use the words in it (I was then accused
of having memorized the Greek New Testament! --untrue); almost every
time I try to find a usage in it, I can't find it there and have to use
the Aland Computer Concordance or the (fine) old Moulton and Geden. 
But for students and those not professionally into the New Testament,
the Schmoller-Koester [no relation to Helmut Koester] is very good, and
in a wonderful small format, nicely printed (neither was true of
Schmoller before Koester).

   There are several lists of special LXX vocab found in Part II, Chapter 4
in the  _Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek_ by H.B. Swete. 

   More striking than the vocab differences from the NT is the grammatical
makeup of the LXX (esp. the syntax).  For a compact grammar of the LXX, you
might want to check out _A Grammar of Septuagint Greek_ by F.C. Conybeare and
St. George Stock (Zondervan [Acadamie Books], Grand Rapids, MI reprint 1980).

   Another suggestion I might make as to extra-NT vocab is that you might
take a look at the vocab appendix in _Hellenistic Greek Texts_ by Wikgren,
Coldwell and R. Marcus. 

  As for a list of most to least frequently used words, I was unable to find
one for LXX Greek/Patristics.  I thought I had one for NT Greek, but couldn't
find it.  But I did find _Lists of Words (Occurring Frequently in the Hebrew
Bible), Seminary Edition_ by John D. W. Watts (Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, MI,
1960. [It is based on Lexicon in Veteris Testementi Libros,
Koeler-Baumgartner (Leiden, 1953)].
   While this isn't what you were look for, I think it gives you a place to
look, it you can't find a Greek list for freq. used words.  I am pretty sure
Eerdmans had a Seminary Edition _List of Words_ for Greek.

    Good luck.

    Peace,

   Tim Staker

I am sorry it took me this long, but I have a few additional bibliographic
items for learning NT Greek vocabulary. One cam choose from a number of
books. The most complete is Trenchard, though its size makes it
threatening. The most useful may be Robinson.

Bruce M. Metzger. _Lexical Aids for Students of New Testament Greek._ New
edition. Princeton, NJ: Theological Book Agency, 1983. Lists of all words
occurring ten or more times in the NT in Part I;Part II contains lists of
words based on stems. Study of this section will increase one's vocabulary
geometrically. This was the standard for the first twenty years I taught
Greek. It is now surpassed by the next three texts.

Thomas A. Robinson. _Mastering Greek Vocabulary._ Peabody: Hendrickson,
1990. A  very practical text. Robinson first gives a list of Greek terms
that have become English vocabulary' then an extensive list of words
arranged by roots (cognate words);  next comes a list of "derived" English
words that will help one to learn Greek; fourth is an explanation of Greek
prefixes and suffixes, i.e. principles of word formation. Careful and
continued use of this work will increase vocabulary immensely. 176 pp.

Warren C. Trenchard. _The Student's Complete Vocabulary Guide to the Greek
New Testament Complete Frequency Lists, Cognate Groupings & Principal
Parts._ Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1992, 340 pp. Includes a complete
frequency list of all words in the GNT.

Robert E. Van Voorst. _Building Your New Testament Greek Vocabulary._ Grand
Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1990. 110 pp.

A work that may give substantial help is

Richard M. Krill. _Greek and Latin in English Today. Wauconda, IL:
Bolchazy-Carducci, 1993. 250 pp., covering both Greek and Latin.

Kurt Aland, ed. _Vollstaendige Konkordanz zum Griechischen Neuen Testament._
 Vol. II: Spezialuebersichten. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1978,
contains many useful lists: Complete statistical data for the text of NA26.
Pp. 449-460 give a list of the words that are unique to each writing (HAPAX
LEGOMENA). This is an extremely expensive set ($850.00) and so you will
find it only in major theological or university libraries.

There is no special list for the Apostolic Fathers. The closest one can
come is the _Index Patristicus_, edited by Edgar John Goodspeed years ago.
Alec Allenson reprinted it in the 1950s, I think, but it is long out of
print.

Finally, if one has the patience, one will also learn a great deal by
working through a larger grammar's discussion of the formation of Greek
words. For this I recommend Herbert Weir Smyth, _A Greek Grammar._
Cambridge: Harvard University Press, reprint of a 1920 original with
corrections. This is the best grammar of classical Greek available in
English; it belongs on every NT scholar's shelves. Smyth also includes
citations from the NT and the LXX at times. Pp. 225-254 treat the
"Formation of Words." The section will not be exciting reading, but repays
careful study.

There are much more substantial works in German whose titles I can give to
anyone interested.

But finally, the very best way to learn vocabulary is to translate some
Greek each day. Begin with the New Testament, add some texts from the
Apostolic Fathers, mix in some Septuagint, and then move on to Greek
authors of the early empire: Musonius Rufus, Epictetus, some Lucian, etc.
Don't be afraid to guess--and then check yourself against a good lexicon,
LSJ for the last group of authors. One learns by seeing the same term in
many new contexts. We all began where you are, so don't despair.

I may be carrying owls to Athens with this communication. If so, trash it.

James Kuiper asks about Moule's Idiom Book.  I published a review of it
when it first came out in 1953 (I've been teaching Greek since 1947), and
consulted it from time to time, especially while preparing my own
TRANSFORMATIONAL-GENERATIVE GRAMMAR OF HELLENISTIC GREEK back in the
1970's.  But while it has good things in it, it is really much more
like what any seasoned Greek scholar might write without being too
systematic or exhaustive; it has his thoughts about those things he
has thought about (very sensible, too), but in no way covers the
field.  It's an "extra" worth dipping into; but not a basic grammar.
(On the other hand, there are almost none of those worth using, when
it comes to Hellenistic Greek.  Plenty of textbooks, of course, some
by contributors to this List, whose books are high quality indeed.)

	What we need is a Hellenistic (or even just NT) equivalent
of Smyth-Messing.  And just that is probably under way to being
prepared, by an outstanding group of young scholars, some of whom
(again!) are on this very List.  But I suspect that is years away.
The problem with Blass-Debrunner of course is that is presumes you
already know Classical Greek, as the people it was written for did.
(And for people like me, who only studied Classical Greek, and
learned Hellenistic, then later NT, by reading thick, verbose
grammars (like Robertson), over-concise ones (like Debrunner),
and really bad ones (like Dana-Mantey), but above all by reading tons
of Greek texts.   I suspect Carl did it the same way.

Fred Danker delivered the completed manuscript of the third edition to the
University of Chicago Press in early April. (Can one call something on a
hard disk a manuscript?)

I called Fred Danker about it; he tells me the target date for its
appearance in print is the Society of Biblical Literature meeting in 1996,
i.e. approximately Thanksgiving of that year.

I no longer have students purchase the 2nd edition because that date is close.

If you want more accurate information, you might drop a note to Prof.
Frederick W. Danker, 3438 Russell Ave., St. Louis, MO 63104. Tel.:

As far as the Loew-Nida work is concerned, it is difficult for a beginning
student to use. The more acquaintance one has with ancient Greek literature
beyond the Greek Bible, the more intelligently one can use it. It is *no
substitute* for a traditional, alphabetically arranged lexicon. I would
probably elect to have student use the old Abbott-Smith lexicon (T & T
Ckark) as a first lexicon, and send them to the library to use BAGD, 2nd
ed.

Hope this information helps. Peace,

If you want to answer your student's questions, you should have Robert Funk, A
Beginning-Intermediate Grammar of Hellenistic Greek.  Vol. I gives good
discussions for the mastery of morphology with enough syntax to get started.
Vol. II is Syntax and Vol. III is a very useful appendix and further
explanation of Morphology.  Many people have found Brooks and Winbery, Syntax
of NT Greek an easy introduction to syntax, but I have often disagreed with
some of the examples selected by Brooks.

Subject: viewing Greek texts and on-line LSJ with Netscape

Some people have inquired about taking a look at the on-line LSJ in its 
current, very *rough*, working form....

My immediate impression is that the on-line LSJ is *much* easier to read than
the print (no surprise). I suspect that it may even be easier for intermediate
students to use than the Middle Liddell or Little Liddell -- after all,
once you have an article, even a long one, you can use Netscape to find 
"Aesch." or "Plat." We would be very interested in feedback both about the
many rough edges remaining in the lexicon and about its usability. Reactions
of both faculty and students would be appreciated.

Most Perseus 2.0 texts are on-line. From the English translations you can
get to the Greek. If you turn on the morphological links button, you can
click on any word and gets its possible morphological analyses. From there,
you can get to LSJ.


Now, to see a sample of our working copy of the on-line LSJ, try, for
example, the following URL:

http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lexindex?entry=a)podi/dwmi


If you want to see some Greek text with links first to morphological
analyses of words and then to LSJ, check out the on-line Perseus texts
at:
