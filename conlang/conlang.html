<h2>Constructed Languages</h2>
<p>Constructed Language here means a language for general purpose communications which was designed intentionally by one person or a small group of people, instead of incidentally by large groups of people.
Examples of interest include: Esperanto, lojban, Interlingua, Frenkisch, and tokipona, but not Modern Hebrew, Nicaraguan Sign Language or Java. ASL was constructed, but is no longer.
